              <P class="" style="font-size: 18px; padding-top:50px;">
                Today’s world thrives on instant gratification. Right from purchasing clothes to ordering one’s favourite food, we expect things to reach us in the shortest possible time. With the advancements in technology, people’s patience levels have diluted. <br><br>
                Financial services are not far behind. Payments have become faster and long queues at the banks have reduced thanks to banking services being available at our fingertips. Technological innovations in the financial sector have been booming at a quick pace and will keep evolving in the coming years.  <br><br>
                One such innovation in the fintech space is that of neobanks, which help create history in the banking sector by helping make banking activities seamless.

    What are neobanks?

  </h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    Neobanks are financial entities having an online presence. They are not present physically like traditional bank branches. These banks provide services like lending, cash transfer, payment services, deposits, etc like a physical bank. The services are faster and more simplified. Neobanks help save customers from the trouble of long waiting times at the bank and get their tasks done at a quicker pace. However, according to RBI guidelines these banks are not allowed to operate independently which makes them partner with a licensed bank to provide financial services.

  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify"> 
    How are neobanks different from traditional banks?
</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    The following is a list of things that differentiate a neobank from a traditional bank:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Neobank charges lesser than a traditional bank
    </b><br>
    Since neobanks don’t have a physical presence they save on expenses like electricity, water, rent, etc which help them in charging less from their customers as compared to that of a bank branch. This also enables them to offer deposits at lower interest rates.
   </li>
    <li><b>Neobank services are easier to use
    </b><br>
    With the help of neobanks, customers can open an account in the comfort of their homes. They are relieved from the troubles of waiting in long lines in front of the bank branch to get their financial tasks done.
 </li>
 <li><b>Neobank apps have smoother user interfaces
     </b><br>
     The apps used by traditional banks usually have difficult interfaces and are plagued by lags. However, neobank apps have a smoother and easier-to-use interface that helps the user carry out financial transactions with ease.

</li><li><b>Fewer rules and restrictions as compared to that of traditional banks

</b><br>
Neobanks are not governed by RBI rules and regulations. This gives them the freedom to offer lower interest rates without complying with the rules that traditional banks are subjected to.

</li>
</ol>
</div>


  <div class="section one container" id="head-3">
      
  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    How are neobanks changing the face of Indian rural banking?
  </h6>
  <P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
  
    A majority of the rural population in India depends on physical visits to the bank to carry out their financial needs. But most of the prominent banks rarely have their bank branches in remote locations which often puts rural people in a fix. 
    <br><br>
    Neobanks looks at solving this problem by helping speed up bank transactions for the rural population. With a vast majority of the population embracing digital payments, neobanks too have the potential to thrive. They have a simpler user interface which is easier to understand compared to that of traditional banking apps.
    <br><br>  
    They also help people carry out most banking activities like transactions, lending, card application, etc in the comfort of their own homes. It reduces the time and energy spent on long visits to the bank branch. For a country like India, which is aiming at financial inclusion, neobanks are a huge step in the right direction.
    <br><br>
    Most people in rural areas prefer to keep all their savings in their houses due to the inaccessibility of bank branches.

  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    5G and how it facilitates neobanks in digitizing rural India

</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    5G is faster than 4G in terms of speed, accessibility and capacity which makes it capable of supporting a great number of devices. This is a vital factor that is crucial in promoting financial inclusivity. Additionally, it helps in reducing the delay in communication.
    According to India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnav, the Indian government is planning to invest $30 billion in establishing 4G and 5G infrastructure to help bring rural India under the purview of digitization. This move is primarily aimed at ensuring the financial inclusion of rural people.
    <br><br>
    The lack of proper digital infrastructure has limited the awareness of rural people regarding the convenience of digital technology. If a proper digital network is provided in such areas, it can motivate financial providers like neobanks to come up with innovative solutions that can help simplify the banking activities of rural India. They can do so by utilizing the possibilities provided by 5G technology.
    <br><br>
    However, 5G has its share of cons as well. One of the main drawbacks is that the 5G range travels only up to a short distance and the presence of physical obstructions like walls, trees, etc can hamper its speed. Another issue is the initial implementation cost of 5G technology and the costs involved in making it easily accessible to the rural population. 
    <br><br>
    Despite the drawbacks, 5G can be used by neobanks to spread awareness to rural people on how financial technology can help smoothen their lives. Upcoming fintech startups can make use of this technology to amplify their services to the rural customer base and thus play an important role in making the country financially inclusive.
