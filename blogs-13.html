                India continues to emerge as a global leader in fintech thanks to the country’s booming startup ecosystem and emerging companies that provide innovative financial services right from online payments to lending and insurance. 
                <br><br>
                Fintech has revolutionized the Indian financial sector through smart technologies like neobanks, digital lending platforms, etc. Fintech companies in India continue to churn out amazing financial products with the help of technology like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, etc to provide innovative solutions.
                <br><br>        
                Even though fintech has been around for quite a while, the sudden increase in its adoption was mainly due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The absence of access to physical financial services during this period forced many into adopting digital financial services. The simplicity, speed and efficiency of these digital services have made people find affection towards them. This has led them to prefer digital services even after the pandemic period had ceased, contributing to growth in the fintech space.
                <br><br>  
                With the exponential growth in the number of people adopting fintech, players in the field have ventured into new opportunities like wealth, insurance, etc in a bid to come up with more exciting product offerings to entice their customers.
