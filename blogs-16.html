                The startup universe has been ever expanding with new ones cropping up each day. However, mostly the ones that are intensively driven by technology and huge funds manage to capture people’s attention. 
                <br><br>
                Apart from these startup giants, several small startups that spring up which are built on tried and tested business models without utilizing enormous amounts of money. But these small startups wouldn’t qualify for funds from venture capitalists or bank loans due to their emerging status. 
                <br><br>               
                Hence alternative modes of funds need to be provided for these startups. This is where the concept of revenue based financing finds its relevance.

  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    What does revenue based financing mean?

  </h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    Revenue based financing is the process of raising capital from investors where they obtain a percentage of the revenue in exchange for the amount of money that they have invested.
    <br><br>
    This amount is paid to the investors based on the amount of revenue generated by the business over a fixed period. In revenue based financing, the regular share of the revenue will be paid to the investors until a predetermined amount determined has been reached. 
    <br><br>
    The payment made to the investor is proportional to how successfully the business enterprise is running. If the business is at a loss, the amount paid to the investor will be low for that period.
    
</p>

</div>


  <div class="section two container" id="head-2">
      
  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify"> 
    How does the revenue based funding work?
</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    In revenue based funding, the people who are investing in the business do not have a direct ownership of the business. The investors will be paid a portion of the total revenue from the business at a pre-fixed percentage until the invested amount has been repaid by the firm. 
<br><br>
    Companies that deal in revenue based financing evaluate the potential borrower on various aspects like its operations, revenue prospects, growth potential etc. Once they are convinced with the borrower, they lend the required amount at a mutually decided interest rate. 
</P>
</div>


  <div class="section one container" id="head-3">
      
  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    Is revenue financing the same as equity financing?
  </h6>
  <P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
  
    Revenue financing carries lesser risk as compared to equity and debt financing. In the case of debt financing, there is an element of higher risk as the borrower needs to repay the fund within a set time frame. Equity financing on the other hand does not have a fixed time limit but it dilutes shares to its lenders.
    <br><br>
    Revenue based financing employs the features of both equity financing and debt financing. As per this financing technique, a person is not required to give up their ownership and there is no fixed repayment period.

  </P>
  </div>

  <div class="section one container" id="head-4">
      
  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    When should revenue financing be considered by a business?

</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    Revenue funding should be considered by a business in the following instances:

</P> 
<li> If a business needs liquid funds for its expansion
</li>   
<li> Businesses that have 6-12 months of revenue
</li>   
<li> When firms plan on having a long term growth
</li>

    <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
        Advantages of revenue financing
    </h6>
  
       
        <ol>
            <li><b>Doesn’t require collateral
            </b><br>
            Revenue based funding doesn’t need one to provide collateral to obtain the required amount of money. It is especially helpful for those firms that are denied funding by financial institutions due to the lack of collateral.

           </li>
            <li><b>Lesser fund disbursal time
            </b><br>
            When a business applies for revenue based funding, it takes as little as 4 weeks to disburse the amount compared to obtaining funds from venture capitalists.

         </li>
         <li><b>Manageable repayment amounts
             </b><br>
             Since the repayments in revenue funding are based on a percentage of the business revenue, the burden of repayments is lesser for a firm during a loss making month.
        
        </li><li><b>Less expensive than equity
        
        </b><br>
        As compared to obtaining funds via venture capital, revenue funding is a comparatively less expensive method of obtaining funds.
        </li>
        </li><li><b>No risk of losing control
        
        </b><br>
        In revenue based funding, investors do not have any control over the firm availing the funding. All decisions and ownership are left to the original founder/founders.
        </ol>
        
    </div>

            Disadvantages of revenue financing
        </h6>
      
           
            <ol>
                <li><b>Not suitable for businesses going through a rough patch

                </b><br>
                Even though revenue based funding looks like a suitable option, the capital handed out to the firm is smaller in amount as compared to that of funds provided via venture capitalists.
    
               </li>
                <li><b>Does not help firms that operate in a deficit
                </b><br>
                This kind of funding is ideal for businesses that have a steady revenue source.
    
             </li>

                What all to look for when considering revenue based financing?

          
          </h6>
          <P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
            The following are a few checkpoints to keep in mind when one is considering revenue based financing:

          </P> 
          <li> This type of financing should be used only if the business is likely to succeed.

          </li>   
          <li> Since the repayment is based on the amount of revenue a firm makes, it is important for a business to make good business to meet its repayment schedule.

          </li>   
          <li>The firm that is looking forward to adopting revenue finance should ensure that all its revenue, operating expenses and future growth prospects should be properly organized.

          </li>   
          <li>The company should have an established market.

          </li>   
          
             </div>

                    Future of revenue financing in India
              
              </h6>
              <P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
                Revenue based financing is a good option for those startups and small businesses that are looking forward to expanding their roots in the future. The concept is still in a nascent stage in India. However, the country being the third largest startup ecosystem in the world, revenue based financing is sure to thrive here.

Most of the small businesses cropping up in India have a direct to consumer (D2C) method and have been operating in the online space. This is a growing market that has the potential for exponential growth in years to come.
<br><br>
India is seeing a rise in the number of D2C firms that come and there are very few funding options that are available to D2C firms in their early development stages. Revenue based funding can help fill this gap. Most revenue fund lending firms are willing to lend huge amounts of money for low interest rates depending on certain criteria set by them.
<br><br>
Even though it seems like obtaining revenue based funding is an easy option, the lending firms use technologically advanced procedures to thoroughly analyze the performance of a firm before lending money.
<br><br>
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic affecting many industries, the D2C sector has managed to boom amidst the crisis. This sector is only set to grow bigger in the future promising a bright path ahead for revenue fund lending in India.
