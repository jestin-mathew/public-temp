    What are NFTs? 
  </h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
  
    NFT or non-fungible tokens are digital assets that are one of a kind. These digital assets represent art, music, memes, gifs, videos, tickets, avatars, etc. They are also known as cryptographic tokens that exist on the blockchain. NFTs can be used to represent real-world items like real estate. 
<br><br>
    They are bought and sold in online marketplaces like OpenSea with the help of cryptocurrencies. NFTs are called non-fungible for a reason as each is unique and has its value assigned.

  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify"> 
Origin of NFT
</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    The thought behind NFT first originated in the year 2012 when a paper titled ‘Overview of colored coins” was presented by Meni Rosenfeld, President of the Israeli Bitcoin Association. It was described as a method that was designed to benefit from the ‘fungibility’ characteristic of bitcoin by separating a certain number of coins from the rest for special reasons. 
    However, due to the limitations of bitcoin, the colored coins concept couldn't be realized. But it served as a foundation for further experiments which led to the invention of NFTs.
    <br><br>
    In 2014, Kevin McCoy, a digital artist minted the world’s first NFT known as the ‘Quantum’. It was an animated art that depicted the beginning of the creation which was sold for $1.4 million. It consists of a pixelated octagon and changes colour in a hypnotic manner. The artwork was sold at Sotheby’s (one of the world’s largest auction houses for fine arts) during its ‘Natively Digital’ curated NFT Sale. 
    <br><br>
    This was followed by several developments in the field of NFTs which led to many platforms dedicated to NFTs being built on the blockchain. Counterparty was one of the notable platforms that were built on the blockchain for the creation of digital assets. 
    <br><br>
    Nevertheless, the bitcoin blockchain was initially never intended to be used as a database for tokens representing the ownership of assets which led to the shift to the Ethereum blockchain during 201-2020. This was a major shift that marked the establishment of certain standards for token creation that enabled developers to create tokens. This was also the era during which NFT gaming gained momentum.
    <br><br>
    The year 2021 can be described as the year of the NFT. This was the year when NFTs rose to prominence. Some of the main factors that contributed to the NFT boom were as follows:
     

</p>
<ol>
    <li>The rise in prices of bitcoin during the first half of the year 2021 led to increased hype across the crypto ecosystem which attracted a lot of crypto users.
    </li>
    <li>The emergence of unique NFT characters and avatars piqued the interest of people, resulting in close online communities and prompting people to purchase NFTs.
    </li>
    <li>Evolution of decentralized NFT marketplaces like OpenSea that enabled people like artists an easy way to mint, view, share and trade their NFTs.
    </li>
    <li>The concept of decentralized finance helped many artists earn handsome incomes by selling their NFT tokens which attracted many people who wanted to see how it worked.
   </li>
</ol>

</p>

           </li>
        <li>Tokenization of real-world assets

    How does NFT work?


</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">NFTs are tokens that are used to assign ownership of digital and real-world assets to people. They hold valuable information and mostly reside on the Ethereum blockchain. These NFT tokens are assigned values based on market and demand. 
    <br> <br>
    Each of the NFT tokens is unique and their values cannot be divided. An NFT can have only one owner. The unique identity of an NFT token is used to manage its ownership. Hence even if one were to screenshot a digital image, they cannot become the owner of that particular NFT. Every NFT has a unique signature to establish its authenticity. It contains all the information related to who owns the NFT, who sold it, its price, etc.
    <br> <br>
    The process of creating an NFT is called minting. As part of the process, it goes through the following three steps:
    </P>

    <li>New block creation
    </li>
    <li>Verifying block information
    </li>
    <li>
     Entering information onto the blockchain        
   </li>
<br>
<p>
    When digital files are minted, NFTs are generated and they are stored on the blockchain. A blockchain is a public ledger that can be accessed by anyone. This information record gives the original creator the right to obtain royalties no matter how many times it is owned or resold.
    </p>

    NFT marketplaces
</h6>
<p class="mt-3 text-justify ">

    These are platforms that function on blockchain technology, allowing people to buy and sell NFTs online. There are generally two kinds of NFT marketplaces: streamlined and augmented. 
<br><br>
Streamlined marketplaces support a broader variety of NFTs while augmented marketplaces provide a more specialized service. Some examples of streamlined markets are Opensea, Rarible etc while marketplaces like ebay, Etsy etc are examples of augmented marketplaces. 
<br><br>
Companies or creators who offer specialized content for a targeted audience can opt for augmented marketplaces. Some of these platforms also offer advanced data analytics tools that can help them make informed choices on their minting process and determine prices for their digital products. 
<br><br>
Product categories with a wider audience can opt for streamlined marketplaces. These platforms are best suited for those products that have simple offerings and appeal to a major segment of the population.

How do I buy an NFT?
</h6>
<p class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    NFTs are mostly bought with the help of cryptocurrency, however, some sites like MoonPay allow people to purchase NFTs with the help of debit or credit cards. These sites convert the normal currency to cryptocurrency which can then be used to purchase NFTs.
    <br><br>
If you wish to buy NFTs with cryptocurrency, it is essential to set up a digital wallet first. One can choose a digital wallet based on the type of blockchain one wants to use. The digital wallet can then be linked to an NFT marketplace and used to make NFT purchases.

        Disadvantages of NFT

    </P>
    <li>
        NFTs are mostly supported on the Ethereum blockchain which consumes high amounts of power and negatively impacts the environment.

    </li>
    <li>They are relatively a new concept in the market and hence subject to risks like scams.
    </li>
    <li>
        They are volatile as it is in an early stage and hence trading in them can be a challenge not suitable for everyone.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is not a regulated sector
    </li>
    <li>
        Investors looking to purchase NFTs with a normal currency are provided with only limited options as the most preferred method of payment is through Ether, a cryptocurrency in the Ethereum blockchain.

Future of NFT
    </h6>
    <P class="mt-3 text-justify ">NFT is indeed an exciting concept that has immense potential to revolutionize the way people interact with the digital world. It most definitely is a technology that is here to stay. It has managed to create a lot of buzz and has captured the curiosity of many.
     <br><br>
        Social media giants Instagram and Facebook are all set to roll out a new feature where creators would be able to create digital collectibles and sell them to their followers. Fans can purchase these NFTs directly through these apps.
        <br><br>     
        However, despite the many attractiveness of the NFT, buying them might be a tad risky due to their prices being highly volatile. Also, it is subject to many risks being an unregulated and decentralized mechanism. The risk of falling into scams is high if one isn’t careful.
        <br><br>
        Despite the risks attached to NFTs, the future definitely looks promising for this innovative concept.
