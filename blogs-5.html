                Blockchains have revolutionized the way transactions are carried out digitally. They are much acclaimed in the present scenario with the adulation for this technology increasing by the day. The concept of blockchain first found its roots in the year 1991 and was developed with the intent to timestamp digital documents so that they are not tampered with.
<br><br>
                However, it mostly remained unused until 2009, when Satoshi Nakomoto (a person or group of persons under a pseudonym) introduced the first cryptocurrency called the bitcoin. It operates on blockchain technology. 
                <br><br>
                With many growing takers for blockchain, it is only set to evolve and get bigger in the future. The ease of making payments and lack of a centralized regulatory authority make it a preferred choice among many. Does its growing popularity pose a threat to banks?
                <br><br>
                Before we dive into the question, let’s begin by exploring what the blockchain is all about.

    What is blockchain?
</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
 
In simple terms, a blockchain can be defined as a shared ledger that helps record bitcoin transactions. It can also be termed as a collection of records that are linked to each other. These records are in the form of blocks that are joined together.


</p>
</div>


  <div class="section two container" id="head-2">
      
  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    How does blockchain work?


</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
 
When a transaction happens between two people, it is inscribed on a block. The block shows each person’s total number of cryptocurrency and the transaction details. Each block makes use of a unique hash. A hash is akin to a unique protection like a fingerprint or pin. 
Every person intending to make a transaction on the blockchain uses two keys: a private key and a public key. A private key is similar to a password and a public key is similar to an email address. Every new transaction that takes place using this technology results in a permanent block on the blockchain. These blocks are validated by people known as miners. 
<br><br>
To qualify as a miner, a person needs to solve a complex mathematical problem known as a proof of work. Whoever solves the problem first will be rewarded with cryptocurrency. They will then have the authority to authenticate transactions happening on the blockchain. Every new transaction that happens creates a new block on the network which is permanent.



</p>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">Blockchain runs on three important technologies which are as follows:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>Peer-to-peer network
  </li>
  
  <li>Private key cryptography which helps secure one’s identity  </li>
  <li>Proof of work which helps in maintaining the current state of the ledger
  </li>
  
</ol>
</div>

    Features  of blockchain


</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">Listed below are some of the prominent features of a blockchain that makes it desirable:</P>

<ol>
  <li>It is a permanent network that cannot be altered
  </li>
  <li>A public ledger that is open to anyone and provides complete transparency
  </li>
  <li>It is a decentralized network meaning that there is no central authority that regulates it
  </li>
  <li>Each blockchain on the network is individually encrypted thus providing enhanced security
  </li>
  <li>A system that provides quick settlement of transactions
  </li>
</ol>

  </div>
  <div class="section one container" id="head-4">
      
  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    Types of blockchain


</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">Blockchains can be :
</P>

<ol>
  <li>Public

  </li>
  
  <li>Private
  </li>
  <li>Permissioned

  </li>
  
</ol>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">Let’s understand each of them in detail

</P>
<ol>
  <li><b>Public blockchain network</b><br>
    In such a network, anyone is welcome to join and participate in the core operation of that blockchain. It doesn't have any central authority regulating the transactions. As it enables participation from several parties to the secured network, it helps prevent data breaches and privacy concerns. More the participants, the safer the network.<br>
    One major disadvantage of public blockchains is that they use a huge amount of energy to function. Also with increasing participants, there is a chance for users to lose anonymity due to their transaction amounts and addresses being visible to other network participants.

  </li>
  <li><b>Private blockchain network
  </b><br>
  Unlike the public network, the private blockchain enables participation only through invites where each participant’s identity is verified. This verification process is done by either a set of established protocols on the blockchain or by a network operator. This helps increase the trust and confidence of the blockchain participants. These are mainly designed for enterprise applications.
 <br>However, these networks are not widely accepted as they are built to perform only specific functions. 

       </li>
       <li><b>Permissioned blockchain network

      </b><br>
      These kinds of networks are a mix of both private and public blockchains. They provide a function known as the Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) function which is compatible with almost all businesses and it helps reduce costs for them. It helps reduce errors and reduces the risk of data altering. These blockchain networks can be used by participants as long as they have permission from the administrators. 
      <br>Information access in permissioned blockchain is slow as compared to other blockchains. Along with it, a business or organization might be faced with integration challenges in a permissioned blockchain.
    
           </li>
</ol>
</div>
  <div class="section one container" id="head-5">
      
  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    Where are blockchains used?

</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
 
  
With its increasing popularity blockchains are increasingly used in several industries and sectors. 

  <br><br>
  Blockchains are used primarily for the following purposes:

  
  
  
  </p>
<ol>
  <li>Cross border payments

  </li>
  <li>Asset management

  </li>
  <li>Data storage

  </li>
  <li>Accounting
  </li>
  <li>Cyber security
  </li>
  <li>Real estate
  </li>
  <li>Identity verification

  </li>
  <li>Internet of Things

  </li>
  <li>Supply chain management
  </li>
  <li>Financial exchanges

  </li>
</ol>

    Advantages of blockchains

</h6>

  <li><b>Increased security
  </b><br>
  Blockchains provide anonymity of user details and make use of specific permissions to prevent unauthorized access. 

      </li>
  <li><b>Better speed and efficiency  </b><br>
    Documentation can be done directly on the blocks in the network, eliminating the need for paper documents. It helps streamline the process and makes it more efficient.

      </li>
  <li><b>Increased transparency
  </b><br>
  Any transaction taking place on the blockchain is recorded permanently. They are also provided with time and date stamps. This makes it possible for the permitted network participants to get the full history of all transitions made.

      </li>
  <li><b>Automated process    </b><br>
    Transactions happening on the blockchain are automated with the help of processes like smart contracts. Smart contracts are full automated processes that hardly require human intervention to ensure that the terms of a contract are met. This is done with the help of third parties.
    both simplicity and protection, increasing customer confidence in utilizing payment gateways for transactions.
      </li>
  <li><b>Faster traceability
 
  </b><br>
  Since blockchains create a trail for each step of the process that happens, it helps provide proof which makes it easier to detect fraud.

      </li>

</div>

<div class="section one container" id="head-7">
      
  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    Disadvantages of blockchains


</h6>
<li><b>Huge implementation cost

</b><br>
It is costlier to implement when compared to a normal database. Also, a business needs to plan well before executing it.


    </li>
<li><b>Hard to modify data
</b><br>
Data once recorded cannot be modified easily in a blockchain network. To modify the data of one block, one needs to rewrite the codes of every block which is a very time-consuming and expensive process that makes it harder to correct errors.


    </li>
<li><b>Increased energy consumption
</b><br>
According to Colombia Climate School, cryptocurrency like bitcoin that runs on blockchain technology takes up around 150 terawatt hours of energy annually, which is higher than that of Argentina (a country with a population of 45 million). This increases the cost as well as the negative impact left on the environment.

    </li>
<li><b>Requires expertise to operate    </b><br>
  The whole process of implementing and managing a blockchain is very tough. One requires thorough knowledge of the concept of blockchain to go through the whole process. Multiple experts are required to handle blockchain issues.

    </li>
<li><b>Storage issues


</b><br>
Blockchain databases are stored on all nodes of the network and as the number of transactions increases, it will require more storage.


    </li>
</div>

  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    How do different countries perceive blockchain?

</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
  India’s approach towards blockchain has been conservative in nature with the Reserve Bank of India even trying to put a ban on them. It's not just India but China also seems to have developed a dislike towards blockchain. This is mainly due to the fact that blockchain is decentralized wherein there is no centralized authority that keeps a check on the activities/transactions happening in the blockchain.
<br><br>
Venezuela is a country where they consider cryptocurrency mining as a method to generate income easily. This is because electricity is cheaper in the country as compared to other nations due to the government heavily subsidizing it. 
Being a country faced with hyperinflation, the people of the country view cryptocurrency mining as a way to combat inflation. Earlier, the country had launched its own version of cryptocurrency called the ‘Petro’ in 2018. It was established with the intent to be an opponent against the dollar. Regardless, Petro failed to win the confidence of consumers and investors. 
</P>
</div>


<div class="section one container" id="head-8">
      
  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    Banks vs blockchains: Who wins?
</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
  The main purpose behind the establishment of banks was to connect different communities together and to assist trade. In an economy, the following are the main roles of any central bank:
</P>
<li>To ensure the safety and stability of the economic system</li>
<li>To make sure that the country is a safe place to invest for longer terms without the fear of inflation</li>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
  Even though banks play a crucial role in stabilizing the economy, there are several instances where transactions can fail which can affect a common man or a business enterprise. Some of the reasons due to which a transaction fails are as follows:
</P>
<li>Technical issues or glitches
</li>
<li>Limits set on transactions
</li>
<li>Accounts getting hacked
</li>
<li>Presence of transfer charges
</li>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
  Meanwhile, a blockchain network helps solve these problems as they are immune to counterfeiting, are protected by a strong algorithm, and do not require a central authority.
</P>

  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    Can blockchain replace banks?

</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
  Being an innovative and efficient technology, blockchain has managed to find many takers. Technology has played a significant role in shaping the financial framework of economies of the world. It has a huge adoption rate and might take up a major chunk of the banking customer base. 
<br><br>
  However, it is unlikely that it will replace traditional banking channels due to some of its disadvantages and design flaws. Due to its unregulated nature, blockchain is used for a number of unethical and fraudulent transactions such as for terrorism, dark web activities etc. 
  <br><br>
  The collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX is an example of the instability that is likely to affect the blockchain sector. Many consumers of the cryptocurrency exchange suffered heavy losses. 
  <br><br>
  Moreover, the Indian government is planning to introduce India’s own digital currency which is likely to reduce dependence on the blockchain network. It works on a demand versus supply model which is not backed by a central authority. Hence it is prone to uncertainties unlike banks. But blockchain is indeed a revolutionary technology which is set to overtake the future if there are some measures set in place to regulate its operations. Right now, blockchain is in a nascent stage with several leaps to take before it becomes widely acceptable.
