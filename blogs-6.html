                Currently, the world is amid an economic crisis that threatens to endanger the financial stability of the future. The signs of a growth slump have already started showing up in three of the world’s biggest economies - the United States, China and Europe.
<br><br>
According to the IMF (International Monetary Fund), the growth percentage has come down to 3.2% this year from 6.1% recorded in 2021. It is also projected that this figure is estimated to go down to 2.9% in 2023. 
<br><br>

Along with the slowed growth, inflation might linger for longer. The inflation rate in advanced economies may rise to 6.6%. In developing economies, it can increase up to 9.5%.
<br><br>
With the advent of this crisis, countries across the globe are forced to tighten their monetary policies, resulting in higher interest rates. Combined with the rising food and energy prices, it is a tough journey ahead for the world economy.
<br><br>
Amidst this setback faced by several countries, it is natural to feel curious about the impact of the economic slowdown in India. Before we dive into it, let’s understand the reasons that fuelled this crisis.

    Why is the global economy slowing down?

</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
 

    The world economy had once slumped during the pandemic period. Even before completely recovering, rising inflation rates sent the globe backtracking in its growth.<br><br>
    One most prominent reason that resulted in the origination of this global economic setback is the financial crisis that affected the U.S, China and Europe. Listed below are the reasons that contributed to this and ultimately resulted in the global economic slowdown:
    
</p>
<ol>
<li>Russia Ukraine war

</li>

<li>Repeated spread of Covid-19 in China and the following lockdown
</li>
<li>Fluctuating oil prices</li>
<li>Geo-political instability like increasing energy costs
</li>
<li>Rising inflation rates due to increased food and energy prices</li>
<li>Diminishing household purchasing power in the U.S
</li>
<li>Deepening real estate crisis in China
</li>
<li>Tightened monetary policies around the world
</li>
</ol>
<p>The onset of COVID -19 pandemic disrupted the functioning of the world economy in a major way. As countries were forced to implement lockdowns, it started affecting trade. Even as demand rose, supply could not be met sufficiently leading to price rises.
    <br><br>
    Along with the price rises, the pandemic confined people to their homes which led to many industries taking a hit. While some of them suffered big losses, many others were forced to cease operations. This resulted in many people losing their jobs. They were forced to withdraw their savings to sustain lives. The surge in withdrawals from banks affected loan disposals, further affecting the functioning of the economy.
    <br><br>
    US’s Federal Reserve Bank had hiked interest rates by 3.75% - 4% for the sixth consecutive time in order to fight the rising inflation. Those who invested in other countries by borrowing from the US bank were forced to close the loans due to the rising interest rate which affected a lot of industries.
    <br><br>
    Since the commodities of the world are traded in the standard US dollar, the dollar strengthening is bound to affect emerging economies like India. However, the economic forecasts for India says that India’s rupee has performed way better than expected but it would slide further before rebounding back in the next fiscal year (2023).
    <br><br>
    The Russia-Ukraine war was another major contributor to the rising inflation. Russia was the major supplier of gas and oil to countries like the US and UK. But with these countries supporting Ukraine in the war, Russia stopped its supply of fuels. This led to dwindling fuel supply, increased fuel prices, affected transportation costs and increased overall prices further sending the world economy spiraling down.
    <br><br>
    With several developing countries being stunned by the rising prices, it is natural to expect that India might be on the list. Surprisingly India seems to be much less affected as compared to other countries. This leaves room for a tiny ray of hope that we will sail past the choppy waves of recession without many casualties.

    The economic slowdown in India: What is happening?


</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
 
    The recession is a cause of concern for many. Especially for a developing country like India, getting hit by the whirlwinds of recession is a scary outlook. India was one of the many countries that were worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. But it has shown remarkable resilience in getting back on track. Similarly, the impact of the global recession seems to have less effect on the country as compared to others. 
    <br><br>
    India also had to increase its interest rates just like the U.S. India’s economic growth rate was lowered to 6.8% according to the IMF from the 7.4%, initially estimated in July 2022. The global recession is said to affect India as well. The population around the world is bound to feel the outcome by the year 2023.
    <br><br>
    According to IMF chief economist Pierre - Olivier Gourinchas, India is expected to have a solid growth rate, even better than the growth rate usually experienced by developed countries. It was expressed that India’s projected growth rate was 6.8% which is a better rate even amidst a globally tough phase.

    Why India is not affected by the global recession



</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">India is a country that is not fully integrated into the economy of the globe which makes it less affected by the harsh effects of the global recession.
    <br><br>
    Another reason that helps minimize inflation impact in India is a proper covid-19 response without overutilizing the budget, leaving enough buffer during times of crisis.
    <br><br>
    The country has also managed to secure efficient macroeconomic policies in advance keeping in mind the possibility of inflation. Some of the macroeconomic policies that were implemented are:
    </P>


  <li>Increasing the policy repo rate under liquidity adjustment facility by 50 basis points to 5.40%
  </li>
  <li>The standing deposit facility rate (A tool used by the RBI to absorb excess liquidity in the market to help control inflation)  was adjusted to 5.15%

  </li>
  <li>Marginal standing facility rate (The rate at which banks can borrow from RBI when they have exhausted all of their borrowing assistance) and bank rate were set at 5.65%

  </li>
<br>
<p>Taxation and public spending were digitized which has helped better the fiscal policies of India.
    A major chunk of India’s GDP is addressed to its domestic economy unlike several other countries that heavily rely on exports. Also the ongoing inflation is mostly a supply led inflation and not a demand led one which makes India immune to the harsh effects up to an extent.
    The demonetisation policy undertaken by Indian government has also helped combat inflation by removing black money out of the system and reducing money supply and finally reducing inflation rate.
    Commodity prices in India have fallen and are at a moderate level, further fuelling India’s defense against the inflation trap.
    <br><br>
    Even when economies around the world are putting in their best efforts to surpass the rough period, India seems to be on a growth improvement path.

How can an individual combat the economic slowdown?



</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    
    Despite reports suggesting that India will bear a lesser brunt of the recession effects, it is bound to affect the Indian population in a visible way. Hence, it is all the more important to be well-prepared to counter the economic slowdown.
    <br><br>
    For an individual, the following are some steps that can be taken:
    

    
</P>


  <li>Push back on big financial purchases<br>
    During times of inflation it is advisable to push back on major purchases like house, land etc to a later date.
  </li>
  
  <li>Invest in mutual funds instead of letting your money idle away in a savings account<br>
    If your money remains in a savings account, in times of inflation it affects its purchase value. Instead, opt for mutual funds.
    
  </li>
  <li>Plan vacations in advance<br>
    If you have larger vacation plans, try pushing them back if possible. It is more affordable to plan for a getaway close to your home and enjoy local attractions. For long distance travel, try booking flights and hotels much in advance.
    

  </li>
  <li>Revise your budget<br>
    Develop the practice of revising one’s budget to find out and cut out those areas that bring in unnecessary expenditure.
    
    
  </li>

    Effects of economic slowdown on businesses in India

</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
 
  
    Even though enterprises at all levels fall prey to the global recession, the worst affected are the MSME sector. With COVID-19 affecting many of them, recession is set to add to their woes.
<br><br>
    These business enterprises are often faced with drastic changes which result in a hard time for them. The consequences of inflation affect the operations of a business in various ways. With an increase in the price of raw materials, wages, rent, transport, fuel, electricity, etc, combating the inflation period is a huge challenge. 
    <br><br>
    Along with high prices, falling demand and sales are also a cause of concern for the business sector.

    How can a business enterprise combat economic slowdown?


</h6>
<p>Listed below are some steps that can minimize the effects of economic slowdown on businesses in India:
</p>
  <li>Diversifying revenue streams
  <br>
  A business can try to diversify its risks by stepping into niche markets or sectors in a bid to balance profits and losses during inflation.

      </li>
  <li>Increase your prices to an extent<br>
    During periods of inflation, it is natural for a business’s expenses to increase. Hence it is only ideal that the business increase its prices to survive the tough phase.


      </li>
  <li>Try cutting unnecessary costs 
    <br>
    During times of crisis, a business needs to cut down on certain services that are no longer required. An enterprise can also try using better substitutes of raw materials that are lower in price during times of inflation.


      </li>
  <li>Automate business processes<br>
    Improving the enterprise process can save both money and time. It helps in completing tasks efficiently and effectively. There are many software that helps a business in making its processes systematic. For example, a business can rely on fintech software to automate their payments.

      </li>
 <br>
<p>
    Businesses require automation to help manage their finances in an easy and efficient manner. They should be able to provide simple and fast payment modules to their customers. It also requires them to reduce the possibilities of fraud and negotiate the credit line.

    Relevance of fintech in business enterprises during a recession


</h6>
<p>
    With digitalization being the norm everywhere, India is not far behind. In fact, the country has been relentlessly pushing digitization to people.<br><br> Digitalization comes with several advantages. It makes transactions smoother, reducing time and energy.
    <br><br>
    Fintech has been one industry that has been growing with the support of several government policies and startups. It has indeed revolutionized the way financial transactions happen.
    <br><br>
    During times of recession, companies have a no better ally than fintech to sail past the turbulent times. It helps them keep track of their financial activities in a better and more efficient way. It is a great tool to receive and keep track of payments and reduce pilferage. With many people preferring digital transactions over cash transactions, incorporating fintech into your business can help you in gaining an edge over your competitors.
