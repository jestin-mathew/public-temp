                The concept of DeFi or decentralized finance has been growing popular at a rapid pace. Its unregulated property makes it an attractive prospect for people interested in crypto investments. But what exactly does a decentralized finance system mean and is it worth it? Let’s have a closer look.

    What does decentralized finance mean?


</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
  
    The term decentralized finance signifies that there is no central authority governing this financial system. It helps people carry out financial transactions without being subjected to the fees that are charged by banks for the services provided to them. This system is created on a public blockchain like Ethereum. The main advantage of decentralized finance is that two parties can carry out transactions on this system faster and more efficiently, without experiencing the delays encountered in a traditional financial system.

    Types of DeFi

</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    A regulatory sandbox provides a real-life testing environment for market participants to test their new innovative products/services. They identify the risks and opportunities carried out by some innovations and help develop a suitable environment that accommodates them. 

</p>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    The following are the types of DeFi systems:

</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Stablecoins

    </b><br>
    These are types of cryptocurrencies that have a stable value and it does not keep fluctuating, unlike bitcoins. They are used for trading goods & services and for international transactions.  
    </li>
    <li><b>Derivatives
    </b><br>
    Derivatives can be defined as a set of contracts whose value is derived based on the underlying value of a financial asset. Some examples of these underlying assets are stocks, commodities, bonds, etc. Derivatives are more accessible for people as they are not required to provide any proof of identity.
 </li>
 <li><b>Margin Trading
</b><br>
Margin trading can be defined as the process of utilizing borrowed funds to purchase assets. It enables a person to purchase more than what he can afford then. In this case, the shares purchased using the lent money will be treated as collateral.
</li><li><b>Decentralized exchanges

</b><br>
This is a system that helps connect both buyers and sellers, enabling them to carry out transactions via a peer-to-peer network. Decentralized exchanges offer benefits like the absence of intermediaries, safeguarding from market manipulation, etc.

</li><li><b>Insurance
</b><br>
Insurance is an aspect found in centralized financial systems which can be replicated in a decentralized financial system as well. The risk protection properties of insurance can be used in DeFi systems to cushion the system from smart contract failures.

</li>
<li><b>Borrowing and lending
</b><br>
Money can be borrowed and lent with ease due to the lack of intermediaries in the decentralized finance system. This helps speed up the process, reducing wait time and frustration that are associated with a centralized financial system.


</li>
</ol>

    Examples of popular DeFi systems

  </h6>

    <ol>
        <li>AAVE<br>
        It is a decentralized lending platform that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency. Smart contracts are used for automating this process. It also helps the platform function without help from third parties.       
        </li>
        <li>Colony lab<br>
        Colony lab is a community-initiated decentralized finance platform that helps power Avalanche, an efficient and low-cost smart contracts platform. 
     </li>
     <li>Fantom
    <br>
    It is developed as an alternative to the Ethereum platform. Fantom is an open-source platform created for trading digital assets. This platform helps in simplifying the process of lending and borrowing.
    </li><li>The Graph
    <br>
    This platform is used for indexing and querying data from blockchains. It helps in grouping data into open APIs known as subgraphs. It enables smooth transactions between applications and blockchains.
    </li><li>Pancake swap
    <br>
    It is a type of decentralized exchange that allows people to trade their cryptocurrencies for others without the help of intermediaries. They make use of an automated market maker that enables them to carry out trading on their own.

    Advantages of DeFi


</h6>
<P class="mt-3 text-justify ">Some of the advantages of using a decentralized financial system are as follows:

    </P>
<ol>
    <li>Easier and fast transactions 
        <br>
        A decentralized financial system enables easier access to these services and transactions are performed at a much faster rate.
    </li>
    <li>Provides transparency
        <br>
        Transactions happening in the decentralized financial system are transparent to all the parties involved.
 </li>
 <li>It is constant and does not undergo changes
    <br>
    Since DeFi systems function based on blockchain technology which is known for its encryption and data protection that is hard to crack, it is a reliable system.
</li><li>Users have more control
    <br>
    Since there is no central authority that governs the decentralized system, users can exercise more control over their finances. 


</li><li>Free of geographical borders

    <br>
    There are no geographical limitations that stop people from making use of the decentralized financial system. Anyone with access to the internet and crypto wallets can make use of the DeFi system.

</li>
</ol>

    Disadvantages of DeFi systems




</h6>
<ol>
    <li>Vulnerable to manipulation

        <br>
        As DeFi systems operate on smart contracts which are vulnerable to manipulation, it might require the particular smart contract to be audited by a third party.

    </li>
    <li>Scalability problems

        <br>
        Blockchains are not scalable which in turn affects the decentralized system which is hosted on them. Due to this sometimes transaction times and costs are affected.

 </li>
 <li>Vulnerability of smart contracts
    <br>
    Since DeFi systems operate using smart contracts, even the slightest issue in the code can lead to a loss of funds.

</li><li>
    Lack of insurance
    
    <br>
    Centralized finance systems are equipped with proper insurance which protects them from unprecedented risks. This is rare in a DeFi system.



</li><li>Over collateralization


    <br>
    In DeFi systems there is always a possibility of over-collateralization when lending. This is because the value of the asset staked by the borrower tends to be higher when compared to the loan amount. It is done to counter obstacles such as credit ratings.

</li>
</ol>

  <h6 class=" mt-5 sub-header text-justify">
    How does DeFi work?



</h6>
<p class="mt-3 text-justify ">
    DeFi systems work on the blockchain network and use the same technology utilized by crypto. They make use of applications called dApps to carry out transactions. These transactions are first recorded in the form of blocks which are then verified by other users.     
<br><br>
If all of these participating users agree on a transaction then that block is closed and encrypted. Apart from this another block too is created which has information about the previous block within it. 
<br><br>
These transaction blocks are chained together and information on one of the blocks cannot be changed without the other blocks being affected. This makes it difficult to hack the decentralized system. The main purpose of a DeFi system is to enable peer-to-peer transactions without the involvement of a third party.

</p>

        Is DeFi the future?
    </h6>
    <P class="mt-3 text-justify ">
        Decentralized financial systems are catalysts for achieving a more inclusive financial market. The usage of smart contracts and blockchain technology is beneficial in helping people achieve faster and more secure transactions. 
 <br><br>
 
These systems can be used as middlemen between institutions for daily settlements without the involvement of a central authority. As consumers have evolved over the years, their service expectations have changed. They prefer a more personalized and less time-consuming service experience. This is where DeFi systems can lend a hand by offering exceptional financial service experiences to consumers. 
<br><br>
Innovations can help fuel the growing affection towards the DeFi system. It will indeed be an unavoidable part of the future financial world.
